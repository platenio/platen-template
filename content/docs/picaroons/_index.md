> A Narrative Game of Adventure for Scoundrels

_Picaroons_ is an adventuring tabletop roleplaying game for picaresque adventures; take on the role of a picaroon,  a rogue who must rely on their wits to make their way in an uncaring world.

Use this game text however you please, so long as you’re not a bigot, fascist, or other piece of dogshit.

This project is under development!

It currently includes lightweight rules for adjudication, character creation/advancement, combat, companions, hirelings, and resting. It _also_ includes 6 picaresques, adventure kickstarts to drop you in media res and get to playing!

You can also buy _Picaroons_ on itch, where it is itchfunding!
